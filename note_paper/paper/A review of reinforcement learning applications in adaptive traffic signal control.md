# A review of reinforcement learning applications in adaptive traffic signal control



## 原文翻译



### Abstract

*In urban areas, the problem of recurring daily congestion is constantly increasing. A possible solution is seen in the application of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems for the control of signalized intersections. While available ATSC systems can achieve an increase in the Level of Service, the focus of ATSC research has shifted towards the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which allow the controller to learn the optimal control policy by direct interaction with the environment. This paper describes the fundamentals of traffic signal control, RL algorithms and approaches and their application to ATSC, with a discussion on the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles on future traffic signal control. In conclusion, a summary of open research questions and possible directions for future research in the domain of RL-based traffic signal control is given.*

在城市地区，每天反复出现的拥堵问题在不断增加。一个可能的解决方案是应用自适应交通信号控制系统（ATSC）来控制有信号的交叉口。虽然现有的ATSC系统可以实现服务水平的提高，但ATSC的研究重点已经转向强化学习（RL）技术的应用，该技术允许控制器通过与环境的直接互动来学习最佳控制策略。本文介绍了交通信号控制的基本原理、RL算法和方法及其在ATSC的应用，并讨论了联网和自动驾驶汽车对未来交通信号控制的影响。最后，总结了基于RL的交通信号控制领域的开放式研究问题和未来可能的研究方向。
