The study could help explain age-related health disparities, including the pandemic's unequal toll, and identify possible points for intervention.   As people age, the immune system begins a dramatic downgrade, a condition called immunosenescence.   People with higher stress scores had older-seeming immune profiles, with fewer fresh white blood cells.   Researchers studied data from a national sample of 5,744 adults over the age of 50.  

T-cells – a critical component of immunity – mature in a gland called the thymus.   As people age, the tissue in this gland shrinks and is replaced by fatty tissue, resulting in reduced production of immune cells.   Past research suggests that poor diet and low exercise are associated with accelerated immune aging.   Improving diet and exercise behaviors in older adults may help offset the immune aging associated with stress.

CMV is known to have a strong effect on accelerating immune aging.CMV is dormant most of the time but can flare up, especially when a person is experiencing high stress. In this study, statistically controlling for CMV positivity also reduced the connection between stress and accelerated immune aging. Therefore, CMV vaccination could be a relatively simple and potentially powerful intervention that could reduce the immune aging effects of stress.
